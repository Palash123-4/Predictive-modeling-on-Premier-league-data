# Predictive-modeling-on-Premier-league-data

**Abstract:** The report contains the description and implementation of a  Poisson & Quasi Poisson regression model being used to fit the football results.
After that, new games can be simulated to analyze the randomness of football league tables. 
Modeling and simulating the results can then be used to predict or indicate the outcome of future football matches. 
The method is to be generalized by adding the concept of exponential smoothing to use the past 10 years data.

The detailed theory and practical result is provided in **PPT_presentation.pptx**. 
Before implementing the **.R** files, it is recommended to understand the work first by observing the PPT presentation.
